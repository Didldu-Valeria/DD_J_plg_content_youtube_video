PLG_CONTENT_DD_YOUTUBE_VIDEO_XML_DESCRIPTION="Content plugin to add YouTube videos inside an article."

PLG_CONTENT_DD_YOUTUBE_VIDEO_EUPRIVACY_LBL="EU Privacy Mode"
PLG_CONTENT_DD_YOUTUBE_VIDEO_EUPRIVACY_DESC="For EU Privacy 'ON' must be active. By default it is setup for EU Privacy. This means the YouTube extended privacy mode ('youtube-nocookie' iframe url) and a special two-click solution to embed the frame not before clicking to your cover. Recommended for Member States of the European Union as well as for other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. If you would like to turn off the EU Privacy mode, switch to 'Off'. NOTE: Custom cover can only be defined at EU Privacy 'ON' mode. By 'OFF' the frame will be implemated directly without the two-click solution cover. Please take note of the privacy policy of your country. We provide no liability for legal correctness!"
